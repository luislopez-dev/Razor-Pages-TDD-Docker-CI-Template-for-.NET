## Enterprise Template for apps in .NET and Razor Pages

## Overview
This project serves as a solid foundation for building web applications with Razor Pages. Its goal is to provide a clear and maintainable starting point that can grow without complications. It is designed for teams or individual developers who want to begin with a well-defined structure without having to reinvent essential configurations.

## Development Approach
The solution follows a TDD-oriented workflow. It includes unit and integration tests that help validate key components and ensure code quality from early stages. The intention is to support safer and more predictable development cycles.

## Continuous Integration
The repository includes a CI pipeline built with GitHub Actions. This workflow automates test execution and verifies that every change meets the defined standards. 

## Runtime Environment
To simplify setup and ensure consistency across environments, the project uses Docker Compose. The configuration includes support for SQL Server, allowing you to easily replicate a realistic database environment for both development and testing.

## YouTube Video
For a short demonstration, I recorded the following video:

## Future Considerations
Although the project already provides a practical and functional foundation, the future may include the possibility of adopting more clean architecture principles and introducing DDD practices if needed to handle more complex scenarios.
